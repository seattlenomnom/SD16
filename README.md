A lot of dumb sections in 16. I did enjoy using the trigraph ?:
x = conditon ? expression1 : expression2. An example: 
x = condition ? 1 : 0;

16.2 Iteration statements I remember, I remember they are more capable than
this text is letting on. Try to remember to experiment with For, While, and 
Do While constructions.
